The dotnet version of [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com), can help figure out the dependency tree of the dotnet assemblies. Especially useful when multiple versions of an assembly \(e.g. NewtonJson\) is direct or indirect referenced, and you want to figure out who is still using the old version.
