See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-dump-files) \(Microsoft\) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump) \(Wikipedia\) for the definition of a dump. A lot of tools can create dump file such as

TaskMgr, [ProcDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump), and Visual Studio itsefl. See ["What is a dump and how do I create one"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/debugger/2009/12/30/what-is-a-dump-and-how-do-i-create-one/).

To debug a dump file in Visual Studio, you can just simply click the `File` -&gt; `Open` -&gt; `File` menu and select the dump file you want to debug.
