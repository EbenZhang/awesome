# Use DotPeek as Symbol Server

dotPeek is a free-of-charge standalone tool based on [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper)'s bundled decompiler. It can reliably decompile any .NET assembly into equivalent C\# or IL code. dotPeek can also perform as a symbol server and supply Visual Studio debugger with the information required to debug assembly code.
