# There is no thread for Async I/O

There is no thread for Async I/O while waiting for the I/O operation to complete. See Stephen Cleary's [blog post](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/11/there-is-no-thread.html)

To know more about lower level details, see [Chapter 6 I/O Multiplexing](https://notes.shichao.io/unp/ch6/) of the book: The Unix Network Programming volume 1. 
Also the Wikipedia's [Asynchronous I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O) is a good introductory page.
